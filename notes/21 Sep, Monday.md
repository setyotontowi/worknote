# 21 Sep, Monday

`Day 227` No more Shuttle

## Early Briefing 
Last week, we've already prepared The Room method for storing thumbnail. Today, I'm gonna do the conjuction in AddDocument so after all the thumbnail loaded, they are stored in Room Persistence. 

- [x] Test Server Testing
- [ ] Apply in AddDocument

## Task 1
`13.43` This is challenging. They force to use thread when using Room. It works well, at the beginning. But eventually closed after several minutes. 

Next Step, use Repository. an Android Architecture Component

## Logs
`07.03` init
`13.43` task 1, not completed
