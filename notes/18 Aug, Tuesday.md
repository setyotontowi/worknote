# 18 Aug, Tuesday

`Day 204` If only I could do better

## Early Notes
Due to accident yesterday, my left part of body including shoulder and knee feel hurt as hell. I barely want to move those part and pretend those wounds don't exist. But this situation, I don't dislike it whatsoever. Instead I feel firing up (Am I masochist?) 

No, in conclusion: **I am reckless**

However, Today's are: 
- Regarding SIMRS Report Tangerang
- ~~Setting up VPN~~
- [x] Cloning Repos
- ~~Investigate Bugs~~
- Breakpoint

Eventually, Back to Edoc. Or do something with Pendaftaran Online regarding Terms and Condition

- Pendaftaran Online
- [x] Republish, since privacy policy has been published (On Hold)
- [x] Rename to Farmagitechs.
- [ ] Republish RSU PKU Banjarnegara
- [ ] Publish RSU Purbalingga

- Edoc
- [ ] Camera: cropping.


## Task 1. Cloning Repos
Unable to connect VPN. Hence: postponed.
Try to cloning repos, blind coded.

## Task 2
**Privacy Policy**
https://sites.google.com/view/evoluzee-rsu-pku-banjarnegara/home

But wait, what if it violates another privacy policy? does it need to confirm to manager first? OnHold. 
**Decision: Under Same Organization**


## Logs
`07.14` init
`11.03` Non technical problem (Task 1, Task 2)
