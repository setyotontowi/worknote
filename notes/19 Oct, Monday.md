## Task 1:
Disabled edit profile:
the origin reason for edit profile because it distinguish between user and patient, while the updates requirement enforces user and patient as one entity.

## Task 3
Notes: It ignores the changes we made in package name. It only merges the changed lines. So, the package name doesn't affect at all. It is fine.  
what evoluzeepkupbg in line 1 stays evoluzeepkupbg even we pull it from upstream. When we pull from upstream, it only cares about whom lines has been changed. 

## Task 4
Waiting for couple hours or 48 Hours for apps to be available
