- [ ] E-Doc: Revision 1: Search

## Task 1
[from this url](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14003036)
[android doc](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/search/search-dialog.html)
problem
SearchView searchView = (SearchView) menu.findItem(R.id.menu_search).getActionView();
searchView NPE(Null Pointer Exception)

[here what i need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ-Z9G0SDhc)
algorithm.
we have 2 different fragment that'll be used. MainFragment and ListPasienFragment.  item that will be search on are inside ListPasienFragment, while search is inside MainFragment.
luckily, method filter is inside adapter.
Issues: can we set the adapter inside MainFragment? and send it via bundle?
or we can change it on main fragment?
