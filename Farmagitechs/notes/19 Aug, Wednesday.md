# 19 Aug, Wednesday

`Day 205` This routine will, by no means, ever cease

## Early Notes
First, take a deep breath. In this current time since I worked here, as time passed by, I have more often emptiness feeling and unwillingness to work. Apparently, I'm in the end of projects that I handled and maybe, that's the cause. My family thought that I should properly resign from here and take the next step. Whether it is in any startups or government instituion. I don't want to bother thinking about it actually. But, because of the feeling I recently have, now I will consider it to be actual act.

Anyway, in this gloomy atmosphere.
- [x] I had to publish and review `Pendaftaran Online` in Google Play. This Checklist is for RSMB
- [ ] This is for Purbalingga, Preparation only
- [ ] Check this whenever you've published both
- [ ] In spare time, then take Edoc. We should add cropping feature in its camera.

## Task 1
Do checking if the app is working well. Use real data you took in database to login.
3304111708930002 - 00008761 RSMB
3303100102750001 - 00005514 PKU Purbalingga

**Pre Release for RSMB accomplished**
perhaps you want to do review.

## Task 2
- preparing firebase (x)
- change id (x)
- change url api
- change package name (x)
- change strings
- change color
- preparing privacy policy
- change package name in PasienBaru4 only

## Task 3
On the other hand, we will run the scenario we previously agreed upon. Keep in mind that we should migrate whole apps including package name and id to Purbalingga - and of course also including the repo. 

So, instead changing stuffs through Android Studio, first we will fork the repo to its own repo then clone it. We can make changes after you clone it since there are no feature addition after all.
