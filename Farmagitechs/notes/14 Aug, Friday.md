# 14 Aug, Friday

`Day 203` Doesn't matter, do something! (2)

## Early Notes
My mind this week is like "How's your progress, is there anything new you learned?" And yup, there were. I learned some minor features in Android and its policy thing. Based on my work notes, I usually do actual work for 4 or 5 hours in a day. With many small kinds of stuff I did within its interval. "Was it not enough?" I do have lots of spare time when at home. And yet I didn't do many things at that time. 

And so, as usual today's tasks are:
- [x] Learning Terms and Condition regarding `Pendaftaran Online`
- [x] Edoc: Convert camera result to bytearray.
- [x] Edoc: Preparing method for send data, as if API has been available
- [ ] SIMRS Report Tangerang (Ah this is the worst scenario)

## Task 1
Usually, I would go into some websites that able to generate terms and condition. But it doesn't meet our criteria explaining that we have to collect user's most important data: NIK. 

There were plans:
- Read plain Terms and Condition in Indonesian App
- Generate and custom myself

I've done created this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, we don't have a place to store that. 

## Task 2
The objective is:
convert image to byte array

## Task 4
- uhh. suspended. 

## And The Insights and Late Notes
- Web Scraping

What will I be in the next 10 months? 
ah, a simple to do list for tomorrow. only for tomorrow. only a simple to do list. 
and buy me coffee or add ads.
