One day, I stumbled upon an article in Medium telling the origin of Gojek. How it started in a small flat with dozen boxes containing tons of wedding invitations has indeed inspired me. I kept reading the articles while seeing the photos attached to it. I'm in awe as the story goes. 

Currently, I'm an Android Developer in a startup in Yogyakarta. I've been doing code for more than three years and working professionally for two years in two different companies. I'm currently developing an archive system for hospitals particularly used among doctors and nurses built using Android and Java. While sometimes also working parallelly with the core product of our company, Hospital Management System. Therefore I'm pretty confident able to adapt to do multiple projects simultaneously.  

I'm aware if I'm not a perfect one nor better than anyone else. I believe there are also lots of good people sending a job application to Gojek. But, each person who has submitted also has uniqueness. Each person has a different mindset. As a mediocre applicant, I have a wish if one day I can join Gojek to enliven the diversity and helping the nation. With something I can only assure that I'm an enthusiast learner and like taking notes. 

Thank you for reading my notes as it goes informal as the story goes. I look forward to meeting with you and sharing each other on how we can raise Gojek with our unique and different thoughts.

Sincerely,
Tontowi Prasetyo
