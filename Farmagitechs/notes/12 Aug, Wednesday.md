# 12 Aug, Wednesday

`Day 201` On minutes transition

## Early notes
Yesterday was rain. It was enough to give clarity on the morning atmosphere and at a distance Merapi can be seen clearly. My mind was ardent last night. Telling me, "Almost everything is on internet isn't it? then you just have to grab it". And given that limitless boundary, I'm so excited to learn soon.

That's the plan, right? Even it gives you tiny information, you have to expand it yourself. 

So Today:

- [x] 1. Edoc: Add Dokumen Pasien
- [x] 2. Edoc: Discovery of minor bugs
- [x] 3. Edoc: Things from trello
- [x] 4. Edoc: PasienFragment onResume refresh
- [x] 5. Edoc: Fatal: positioning in TipeAdapter is not right. 
- [ ] 6. SIMRS V2: New Menu, which I don't know what


## Task 1 
Is there anything new to learn?
- [x] Button in cards (triple dots popup) (this)
- [x] Marking origin

Uhh. I thought, we also can add shortcut to Direktori Pasien through button popup in that card. 

## Task 2
When Preview Activity is opened from PasienFragment, it likely doesn't send document identification and attributes. 
- [x] About that. Send the data, immediately

## Task 3
On very first recognition, Mas Joko told me about back route of certain activity. That is
- [x] Preview back pressed from Add Document

Then, a whole attribute form revision
- [x] (What is it?) Information, Obviously
- [x] Default Text
- [x] Dropdown label form

Passing default value for Label
- [x] on list visitation, its service. where to put?
yep. using SharedPref

Verbose
- [x] Progressbar on save document
- [x] and also, search icon somehow

## Late Note
Apple do make something interesting in this year. They will design their own ARM processor for upcoming macbooks. This likely becomes game changing. With their own processor, they could maximize performance as it not depending on Intel processor. 

Keep in mind that they want to go further. As creating fully custom processor.
I too, have ideas from their way of thinking. And I want to "fully into" android. Understanding until the edge of knowledge.
