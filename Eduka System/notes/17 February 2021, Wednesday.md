5 Rajab 1442, `Day 31`

Yesterday, I made a serious mistake to update multiple times at once week. It reduced the app rating and harm the marketing team. However, no great app management for android and that make me confuse what should I do next, also no quality assurance as well.

We're much smaller than I thought it be.

- [x] The second activity, bridging
- [x] The second activity, layout
- [ ] Analyze the doc, priority number 2 in airtable
- [x] Analyze the bug on dev api ver 2

## Task 1 Bridging
1. ProgressTryoutFragment 
2. for the background, it's okay to use blue first and try to animate another background. add toolbar
