Scrum Fatigue
For first week or two, it's hard to maintain confidence whenever in daily standup. For me, any step I choose should represent the best one and I have to make sure I didn't make any mistake. This first week is a form of adaptation. Fortunately I am aware it soon enough before everything gets worse.  

And how to handle it?
