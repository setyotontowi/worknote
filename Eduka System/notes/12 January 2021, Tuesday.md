# 12 January 2021, Tuesday
28 Jumadil Awwal 1442 `Day 7`

1. Scrum Fatigue
For first week or two, it's hard to maintain confidence whenever in daily standup. For me, any step I choose should represent the best one and I have to make sure I didn't make any mistake. This first week is a form of adaptation. Fortunately I am aware it soon enough before everything gets worse.  

And how to handle it?
about daily standup, make sure you have the clear image of what you did that day. It's about fifteen minutes before you can arrange some sort of mini presentation. 

2. Productivity
I counted that I've lost about 20% of my productivity during this pandemic wfh. Because too many distraction and saturation that happen frequently. 

And how to handle it?
Pomodoro technique, are you forgetting about that? we can set up mini sprint for this whole marathon
