# 26 January 2021, Tuesday
13 Jumadil Akhir 1442 `Day 17`

- [x] Examining Major Features
- [x] Implement Pop Up Starting design 
- [ ] First scenario when free and explanation enabled

First thing first. Check the requirements for task 1 in airtable
For task 2, estimating done in this week? yeah sure. perhaps for a couple days

## Task 2

jadi free exam bisa dikasih opsi untuk melihat pembahasan ketika pembahasan dimulai (yang mana waktunya juga sama ketika waktu exam dimulai)

start by doing the dialog first

## Briefing
on Nasi Padang, Try Out Dummy 2 the session is already passed yet it still on "Belum Dikerjakan". When open, it show the explanation immediately (the popup should interfere this action). 

Next is search where this action is triggered

1. See the first time open? shared preferences? perhaps with id-events
2. pop up? when tier is free
3. redirect and actions

Scenario
-> popup enabled when lihat pembahasan is clicked (this) OR when event detail is showing on first time?
-> when pembahasan is disabled because the session ends and wait for pembahasan time but the user hasn't done the exam yet (the first popup)

## Task 3
- [x] Seperate FREE and PREMIUM action
- [ ] Shared preferences not complete. 

Shared preference planning
- create different xml?

## Logs
`06.00` init, examined - they're preparing things, task 2 started
`07.00` task 2 complete.
`08.00` task 3 on going
`09.00` task 3 on going
