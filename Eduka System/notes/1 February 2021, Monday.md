- [x] Write weekly report
- [x] Check in Airtable
- [ ] Popup refinement -> testing
- [x] Planning
- [x] Check Logic TO Flexi
- [ ] [Revamp statistic page if there is no data](https://airtable.com/tblM62woEhEiVAjm3/viwq0u5R7YBoLHO3O/recoWw4Yc9r6nGqIF)
- [ ] Learn something in Figma?

## Task 2
for meet later

## Task 3
it is solved. but after the dialog is showing. the whole logic is in mayhem.

## Task 5
Search and Read documentation in confluence about TO Flexi.
Assumption: Tryout flexi is a tryout that you can do everytime. So, it doesn't have end time whatsoever.

so the logic is basically from the admin page. whats wrong? check airtable
as in production. we can simulate the to flexi with this
1. pembahasan time is early
2. start time is early
3. end event is finite but long
4. end event time for free is infinite

so if event within the app is satisfy those conditions above, it passed the task.

For enrolled user and not enrolled user E NE
Done D
Ongoing O Before B After A
Time
1. Ongoing E, NE
2. Before E, NE
3. After EP, NEP

The Problem
EP : Check more - E. After If i finished an exam, the flexi exam dismissed and not showing everywhere. unless logout-login.
NEP: tryout showing? even the event is after the due date? 

Logic, Case Premium All.
- [x] Check what condition makes users can do their exam EO, EA
- [x] Check what condition makes users can see "pembahasan" EAD
- [ ] Make sure those logics is correct for further TO flexi

**Question**
TO Flexi only for premium? if free is the popup for seeing explanation is also applied in Flexi?
the reason

## Task 6
searching for design. check in android

**Question**
Kan statistik cuma bisa ada karena user telah mengerjakan soal, if no data maksudnya gimana?
