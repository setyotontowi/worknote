# 5 January 2021, Tuesday
21 Jumadil Awwal 1442 `Day 2`

Planning for today
Examining the flow
- Application Flow from login
- Imagine if there is a feature request
- Mapping the files

Oke, what are we gonna do rn?

**First Hour**
Splash Activity -> Login -> Registration
Splash Activity -> Home

- All the features is indeed inside features package, like every transaction belong to it.
- Applying the clean architecture pattern

**Second Hour**
- Clean Architecture
- Yes, it use view model, the pages?
- activity grouping? 
- the questions about business process.

**Third Hour**
- so every transaction are independent in own class?
- style coding?
- [for the insight](https://medium.com/style-theory-engineering/android-clean-architecture-using-kotlin-48306644ada7)
- the setting page should not be called setting page.

**Fourth Hour**
- focus on interactor and usecase

**Fifth Hour**
- unfamiliar classes, Either. How to get usecase data. is it for 
- create flow up to fetching the data and implemented in adapter

**Need to confirm**
- style coding, how to handle nullable etc (personally)
- clean architecture, perhaps create some project applying this 
- business process (UTBK, Kerjasama, Flexi)

**To be presented**
- Explain DI, there are 2 modules ApplicationModule and ViewModelModule. (familiar)
- Explain MVVM through clean architecture (know the flow)
- How to create clean architecture, particularly in (interactor and usecase). because I will use it frequently
- Explain the flow on event features, while asking the business process (UTBK, Kerjasama, Flexi)
- What are you going to do: Create similar project, implement 

**Next things to do**
- Implement CA on similar project (until weekend, parallel to thursday presentation)
- Create flow and learn unfamiliar classes: Either, UseCase, 

How to implement
