- [x] Continue to implement Profile Improvement

## Task 1
If filter add school with index 0
Search where filter is. assumption in setSchool, but I didn't understand how they actually filtering.
even the whole setShool is commented, it still performing filtering. assumption 2, do after text changed.

assumption, create custom adapter. the reason is the filter is automatically filtering when user set a new character in editText, so no way to intercept as adding a new object (School 0) to list. If the school 0 is added before filtering executed, it disappeared as user perform filtering (Lainnya not found/not filtered). overriding filter/getFilter

debug
check logic.
