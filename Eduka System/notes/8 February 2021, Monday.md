- [ ] Fix bugs from crashlytics
- [ ] Architecture of Quiz Integration

## Task 2
- prepare git, cleaning
- separate module using dagger. add module quiz or migrate module ptn? perhaps, migrate module ptn
- to migrate module ptn we use dagger entirely, so examine the dagger implementation first. also the dashboard page. so the app only consist of dashboard activity?
- create depedency on ptn
  this means edukaptnmodules that includes similarity of viewmodels etc?
  how to put it out. copy (safer but slower) 
- Examining KittiesApp

**Action 1**
- Sync Gradle with Java Class (not necessary)
- Assumption, copy the gradle. 
- How about not migrating but rather do quiz first? so the first thing is copy the essential

:the essential list:
- core, isn't it can be copied as it depedent? Create activity or fragment, like feature? copy the main activity (should be altered then)
- try connect using simple fragment. somehow it can provides directly to the app via import. is this right? assuming for now it is. go on. learn through git. search it on github for multi module project
the module is depending itself!

`07.00` preparing migration
`08.00` migration process
`09.00` migration process
