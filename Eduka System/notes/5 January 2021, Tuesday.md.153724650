# 5 January 2021, Tuesday
21 Jumadil Awwal 1442 `Day 2`

Planning for today
Examining the flow
- Application Flow from login
- Imagine if there is a feature request
- Mapping the files

Oke, what are we gonna do rn?

**First Phase**
Splash Activity -> Login -> Registration
Splash Activity -> Home

- All the features is indeed inside features package, like every transaction belong to it.
- Applying the clean architecture pattern

**Second Phase**
- Clean Architecture
- Yes, it use view model, the pages?
- activity grouping? 
- the questions about business process.

**Third Phase**
- so every transaction are independent in own class?
- style coding?
- [for the insight](https://medium.com/style-theory-engineering/android-clean-architecture-using-kotlin-48306644ada7)

**Need to confirm**
- style coding, how to handle nullable etc
- clean architecture, perhaps create some project applying this 

**To be presented**
- How to create clean architecture, particularly in interactor and usecase
- explain the flow on event features, while asking the business process (UTBK, Kerjasama, Flexi)
